This Modern font with strong ties to Bodoni and Didot is an great example of a classic styling applied to screen design requirements. It is more condensed than its more classic counter parts but has a few truly lovely details notably the sweeping tail of the Q and of course its ampersand. The 'et'  was the original ligatures that became the ampersand and it is clearly visible in this figure. What sets this letterform apart is an almost script like cross bar on the 't' and a generous width and counter givening it a lot of presence even when set in the middle of a body of text.
